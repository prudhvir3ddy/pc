## CPU 

Intel, AMD

Intel i5 13600KF

13 - generation ( latest the better )
600 - model number ( higher is better )
k - overclockable ( unlocked, extract more performance from the hardware. You need motherboard, powersupply, cooling that supports this. )
F - No integrated graphics ( If you have the dedicated GPU, You can pick a chip that has letter F to save some money on processor )

### Metrics

- Cores 
- Threads 
- Clock speeds 

Cores = number of mini CPUs in the chip
Threads = higher the count, the better it is to more process more number of things in parallel 

Modern CPUs uses this technology 
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/gaming/resources/hyper-threading.html
> Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology is a hardware innovation that allows more than one thread to run on each core. More threads means more work can be done in parallel.

Clock speed = How many cycles a core can achieve within a second 

5.0 GHz = 5 billion things per core per second 

5 cores with 5.0 GHz  is as powerful as 10 core 2.5GHz 

## Motherboard 

A hub for all components in the system - CPU, RAM, storage, graphic card, distributing them power and enable them to function as unified system 

Components You'll Find

- CPU Socket: Where the processor is installed.
- RAM Slots: For memory modules.
- PCIe Slots: For expansion cards (graphics, sound).
- Storage Connectors: For SSDs and HDDs (SATA, M.2).
- Power Connectors: From the power supply.
- Back Panel I/O: USB ports, audio jacks, Ethernet, display outputs. 

Based on the CPU you picked, the motherboards would get filtered out, different generations are compatible different motherboards

If you purchased an overclocked CPU, you would need a motherboard that supports it. 

Key term: Chipset ( lookout for the features )

Cheaper motherboard doesn't bottleneck your other components, it might not just support overclocking 

Things to look out for: 

- Supported ethernet cable 
- High speed USB-C

## Cooler 

Each CPU requires certain cooling temperature, if we don't keep the cpu at that temperature, we will face thermal throttling which slows down the CPU. 

We need to buy the cooler based on the CPU heat output 

Categories 

- Air cooling 
- Liquid cooling 


## RAM 

Generations: DDR3, DDR4, DDR5, ... 

Buy the RAM based on the latest supported generation by your CPU 

Ensure your motherboard has extra slots for RAM for future upgrades. 

Factors: 

- Generation 
- Speed ( Higher speed is better, ensure the CPU / Motherboard supports it )
- Latency ( CL16 is better than CL18 at the same speed )
- Dual channel ( Using two sticks is better than one - 2x16, 2x8. adds perf boost of ~10% with dual channel ).
- Volate ( ensure motherboard supports this voltage )

## Storage 

- ensure to get an SSD over HDD ( massive difference in speeds. You can get an HDD for storage but operating system and programs should be running on the SSD )

Factors: 

- generation ( latest is better. each generation has cap on speeds )
- read speeds / write speeds 
- you can save money here on buying SSD without heat sink ( ensure your motherboards has the SSD cooling support ) 


## Graphic card 

More VRAM is better, for general usecase better to buy T-1 generation card and save money

## PSU 

Pick the GPU and then buy the recommended power supply for that GPU. Go with higher volatage number for future proofing 

types 

- Non-modular
- Semi modular 
- Modular

Buy 80 plus gold benchmarked PSU 

## Cabinet 

Ensure it fits motherboard and has the form factor to fit in all other components

ITX ( smallest )
Micro ATX
A-ATX
E-ATX ( largest )
