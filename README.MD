## Detailed Guide

### CPU

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the brain of your PC. Powerful CPUs are preferable for gaming, content creation, and general productivity.

**Popular Brands:** Intel, AMD

#### CPU Example

- *Intel i5 13600KF*

    - **13** - Generation (higher and newer is better)
    - **600** - Model number (higher is better)
    - **K** - Overclockable (unlocked, for higher performance; requires compatible motherboard, PSU, and cooling)
    - **F** - No integrated graphics (choose if you have a dedicated GPU)

#### Key Metrics

- **Cores:** Number of mini CPUs on the chip (higher = better multitasking)
- **Threads:** Processes that cores can handle simultaneously (higher = better parallelism). See [Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/gaming/resources/hyper-threading.html).
- **Clock Speed:** Number of cycles a core completes per second (*e.g.,* 5.0 GHz = 5 billion cycles/core/sec). Both core count and speed are important.

#### Quick Tip

- *5 cores @ 5.0 GHz ≈ 10 cores @ 2.5 GHz* (approximate—real-world performance may vary)

### Motherboard

The motherboard is the central hub connecting all components and distributing power. Its chipset and features determine supported CPUs, RAM, storage, and expansion cards.

**Key Components:**

- CPU Socket  
- RAM Slots  
- PCIe Slots (for GPUs, sound/network cards)  
- Storage Connectors (SATA, M.2)  
- Power Connectors  
- Back Panel (USB, audio, Ethernet, display, etc.)

**Advice:**

- Choose a motherboard compatible with your CPU’s generation and socket.
- Select a chipset that supports your needs (overclocking, expansion, connectivity).
- Lower-end boards may limit features but won’t always bottleneck performance unless overclocking.
- Look for modern connectivity (e.g., high-speed USB-C, 2.5G/10G Ethernet support).

---

### CPU Cooler

Cooling is essential to prevent thermal throttling and maintain performance.

**Cooler Types:**

- **Air Cooling** (affordable, reliable)
- **Liquid Cooling** (better for overclocking, high-end builds)

*Select a cooler rated for your CPU’s heat output (TDP).*

---

### RAM (Memory)

RAM is crucial for system speed and multitasking.

- **Generations:** DDR3, DDR4, DDR5 (choose latest supported by CPU/mobo)
- **Capacity:** 16GB+ standard for modern systems
- **Speed:** Higher MHz is faster, but make sure CPU/motherboard support it
- **Latency:** Lower CL (e.g., CL16 < CL18) is better at the same speed
- **Dual Channel:** Always use paired sticks (e.g., 2x8GB) for 10%+ performance improvement
- **Voltage:** Ensure compatibility with your motherboard

**Tip:** Leave slots free for future upgrades

---

### Storage (SSD/HDD)

- **SSD:** Much faster than HDDs—install your OS and programs here
- **HDD:** Optional for mass storage (media, backups)
- **Interface:** Choose NVMe (M.2) for best SSD speeds, or SATA for budget builds
- **Heatsink:** Some SSDs come with heatsinks; some motherboards provide cooling

**Things to consider:**

- Generation (e.g., PCIe Gen 4 > Gen 3)
- Read/Write Speeds
- Capacity (500GB+ SSD recommended as a baseline)

---

### Graphics Card (GPU)

- Key for gaming, 3D, and creative applications
- **VRAM:** More is better for modern titles and higher resolutions (8GB+ is common)
- Buying previous-gen (T-1) cards can be cost-effective
- Ensure PSU and case compatibility

---

### Power Supply Unit (PSU)

Supplies power to all components. Always buy from a reliable brand and choose an appropriate wattage (plus headroom).

- **Wattage:** Choose based on GPU requirements (use online calculators)
- **Modularity:**
    - Non-modular (all cables fixed)
    - Semi-modular (some fixed, some removable)
    - Modular (all cables removeable; tidier build)
- **Efficiency:** Go for 80 PLUS Gold or better for efficiency & safety

---

### Cabinet/Case

Select a case that fits your motherboard size and all components.

- **Sizes:**
    - ITX (smallest)
    - Micro ATX
    - ATX (standard)
    - E-ATX (largest)
- Ensure good airflow, cable management, and clearance for GPU/cooler/PSU

---

## Assembly Steps

1. Prepare your workspace (antistatic precautions)
2. Install CPU onto motherboard
3. Mount RAM & M.2 SSD
4. Fit CPU cooler
5. Place motherboard into case
6. Connect PSU, route cables
7. Install storage drives (if any additional)
8. Place GPU in PCIe slot
9. Connect case front panel, fans, and I/O
10. Power on & enter BIOS for initial check
11. Install OS (Windows/Linux) & drivers

---

## Additional Tips

- Watch video guides if unsure about installing specific components
- Use PCPartPicker to check compatibility
- Update BIOS & drivers for best stability
- Plan cable management ahead of time

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQs

- **PC doesn’t power on:** Recheck PSU switch, cables, and front panel connectors
- **No display:** Ensure GPU is correctly seated and power cables are secure
- **Overheating:** Double-check CPU cooler install and fan orientation
- **Boot issues:** Check RAM seating and compatibility
